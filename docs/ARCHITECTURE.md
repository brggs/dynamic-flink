# Architecture Overview (repo-level stub)

This repository currently contains the `flink-job` module (see `docs/DESIGN-flink-job.md` for details). As new components are added (e.g., control plane/services, UI, deployment manifests), expand this file with:

- High-level system diagram (data/control flows, boundaries).
- Module list with responsibilities and key tech choices.
- Integration points (APIs, message formats, contracts).
- Operational/deployment considerations.

For now, this stub exists to anchor future cross-module documentation.
